Virginia Tech - Trainees preparation
==============================

A crucial point for the workshop to be successfull, is to minimize the risk of getting stuck on technical issues and optimizing the individual support for the participants. For this a good trainer/participants ratio is central. So every support in this is helping the participants and delivers to the quality of the workshop experience.

To be well prepared for the workshop we simply recommend to do following things:
1. Install [getpapers](https://github.com/ContentMine/getpapers), [norma](https://github.com/ContentMine/norma) and [ami](https://github.com/ContentMine/ami) locally. You can find more about this [here](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM#option-1-install-software-locally-recommended).
2. Install [pyCProject](https://github.com/ContentMine/pyCProject), if you want to use Python for analysis.
3. Do the software tuturials for [getpapers](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/getpapers/README.md), [norma](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/norma/README.md) and [ami](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/ami/README.md).
4. introduce yourself to [CProject](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/cproject/README.md)
4. Do the [Zika virus tutorial](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM/tree/master/tutorial/zika), if you use Python. You need to install Jupyter notebook for this.
5. Apply the tools to your own field of research

Other things to be aware:
- technical support: there should be a person who feels responsible for technical issues. For example, when the beamer does not work, or the wifi breaks, or when we need more power distribution.
