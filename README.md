In this approximately one hour long session, we will give an introduction into text and data mining and the [ContentMine](http://contentmine.org) project. This includes the basic concept of TDM, legal issues, TDM with scholarly literature, use-cases and short demos about how we do it with our ContentMine toolchain. There will also be time for questions.

**Occasions**
- 11th of April - 12:30-13:45h
- 11th of April - 15:30-16:45h

### Introduction to ContentMine Tools for Life Sciences Research

This will be similiar to the Introduction to ContentMine Tools for Mining Scholarly & Research Literature session, but will focus on life sciences and the practical parts.

**Occasion**
- 12th of April - 11:15-12:05h

### Text and Data Mining Forum

A discussion with researchers and Tom Arrow from ContentMine about opportunities and challenges related to text and data mining, with a focus on information access.

### ContentMine Tools to Explore Scholarly & Research Literature - Full Day, Hands-On Workshop

**13th of April - 9-16h**

The full-day workshop will be the final event, where the shown practices are finally applied. The first part will be a general introduction into text and data mining and our software. The second part will be hands-on, where every participant is able apply the ContentMine software for their own research and/or interest. 


**[Registration](http://guides.lib.vt.edu/OpenDataWeek/RSVP)**


**Requirements**

To be able to participate during the workshop, you need a running installation of our ContentMine software. To reduce the risks of bandwith problems during download or installation errors, we recommend to install the software in advance and test it, if it is running.
- Install the needed ContentMine software. You have two options (we recommend the virtual machine image): 
	- install the [Virtual Machine Image 2017/04](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7pJKedx9b97emhKLUNiVjNLWEk), where all software is included. You can find more information how to setup the virtual machine [here](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/tree/master/software-tutorials/vms).
	- [install the software locally](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM#option-1-install-software-locally-recommended)
- bring your laptop with power supply

**Preparation**

The following actions are not required but may help you to get the most out of the workshop. We especially recommend you to install the software in advance, so you can directly start or ask questions if you have issues with the installation process.

- [pyCProject](https://github.com/ContentMine/pyCProject): if you want to analyse the mined facts in Python, you should install our Python wrapper for the [CProject](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/cproject/README.md).
- do our [software tutorials](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/tree/master/software-tutorials) (optional): this helps you to get used to our tools and to get the most out of the workshop. The relevant ones are:
	- [getpapers](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/getpapers/README.md)
	- [norma](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/norma/README.md)
	- [ami](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/ami/README.md)
	- [Zika virus](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM/tree/master/tutorial/zika): this is our most recent tutorial, which focuses on TDM techniques around the Zika virus. It uses a Jupyter notebook for the analysis part.
