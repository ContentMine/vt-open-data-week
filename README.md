The workshop will be the final event, where people can learn and apply text and data mining with the ContentMine software. The first part will be a general introduction into text and data mining and our software. The second part will be hands-on, where every participant is able apply the ContentMine software for their own research and/or interest. 

**Requirements**

To be able to participate during the workshop, you need a running installation of our ContentMine software. To reduce the risks of bandwith problems during download or installation errors, we recommend to install the software in advance and test it, if it is running.
- Install the needed ContentMine software. You have two options: 
	- [install the software locally](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM#option-1-install-software-locally-recommended)
	- [install the Virtual Machine image](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM#option-2-use-the-virtual-machine), where all software is included

**Preparation**

The following actions are not required but may help you to get the most out of the workshop. We especially recommend you to install the software in advance, so you can directly start or ask questions if you have issues with the installation process.

- [pyCProject](https://github.com/ContentMine/pyCProject): if you want to analyse the mined facts in Python, you should install our Python wrapper.
- do our [software tutorials](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/tree/master/software-tutorials) (optional): this helps you to get used to our tools and to get the most out of the workshop. The relevant ones are:
	- [getpapers](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/getpapers/README.md)
	- [norma](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/norma/README.md)
	- [ami](https://github.com/ContentMine/workshop-resources/blob/master/software-tutorials/ami/README.md)
	- [Zika virus](https://github.com/ContentMine/FutureTDM/tree/master/tutorial/zika): this is our most recent tutorial, which focuses on TDM techniques around the Zika virus. It uses a Jupyter notebook for the analysis part.
